# infra-with-k8s
A project containing a simple infrastructure built with kubernetes

There's a client built with React <br>
A server built with Node <br>
A microservice also built with Node <br>
And a database that uses the official image of postgres <br>

In the k8s folder everything is configured properly, just applying the files will do the job

There's also the folders and files in order to run the app locally, it can be ran using the docker-compose file or running each project independently
